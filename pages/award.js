                                    <p className="pb-5">Consistently the existences of roughly 1.3 million individuals are cut short because of a road traffic crash. Somewhere in the range of 20 and 50 million additional individuals experience non-fatal injuries, with many causing a disability because of their physical issue.
                                    </p>

                                    <p className="pb-5">Road traffic injuries make high economic losses for people, their families, and to countries in general. These misfortunes emerge from the expense of treatment as well as lost efficiency for those killed or crippled by their injuries, and for family individuals who need to get some much needed rest work or school to really focus on the harmed. Road traffic crashes cost most nations 3% of their GDP.
                                    </p>

                                    <p className="pb-5 ">So here we design a system that can alert the vehicle owner/loved ones over sms as soon as any signs of accident or may lead to an accident are detected. As well as the system stores all readings that lead and happened during the accident so that investigators may study exact causes of accident to avoid further such instances.</p>

                                    <p className="pb-5">The system makes use of Temperature sensor for fire detection in car, Vibration sensor to detect any impact force or heavy vibrations, Alcohol sensor to check if driver was drunk, gyro scope sensor to record data if vehicle tilted or turned over during accident and a GPS and GSM modem to send SMS with GPS Coordinates about the incident. This complete system is now powered by an Arduino Mega to operate the system.</p>
                                    <p className="pb-5">The system also has 2 Motors used to demonstrate as car engine. We can increase the speed of Motors using Trimpot. As we increase the speed beyond set limit, the system detects over speeding and sends an SMS Message with over speeding alert and GPS coordinates to registered number. </p>
                                    <p className="pb-5">The system monitors all sensor data to check for any abnormalities. If the fire sensor detects a fire, the controller operates the interfaced GSM modem to send an SMS to the registered contact number informing about the event and also starts recording data.
                                        Similarly if the vibration sensor detects heavy vibrations, the controller sends SMS to registered number informing about the event to the registered user. Is alcohol sensor is triggered the controller similarly sends an SMS notification with alcohol data and GPS Coordinates on Map link for easy vehicle location tracking.
                                        In case of any sensor triggers an abnormal activity the black box starts storing all sensor data on a second by second basis in an SD card so that investigation team may recover the data and study exactly what went on during the accident.

                                    <p className="pb-5">Indicators have been long used in cars for turning indication. One usually needs to switch the indicator in a particular direction before taking a turn. Also one is supposed to switch respective indicator before changing lanes on a highway to signal. Another problem is the braking lights, the red braking lights are not visible enough during day.
                                    </p>

                                    <p className="pb-5">Well here we design a digital car indicator system that automatically operates the car indicator with a digital display without needing the user to switch anything manually. The system when mounted on a car delivers following advantages:</p>

                                    <p className="pb-5 ">The system makes use of a Atmega 328 Microcontroller along with an accelerometer gyro sensor, LED display board, buzzer, buttons, basic electronics circuitry and PCB board to develop this system. The system will put forth a next generation automatic direction and braking indicator display system. The system when started constantly monitors tie accelerometer gyro sensor for signals. The sensor gives away directional signals then sensing a directional change and also a change in acceleration is detected on braking.</p>

                                    <p className="pb-5">When the vehicle turns or changes lane, it is sensed by the sensor and this signal is read by the controller. The microcontroller now checks the signal and detects the direction of turning. It now displays arrows pointing to that particular direction on LED display. When the vehicle brakes there is a sudden deceleration in vehicle speed that is detected by the accelerometer sensor. This signal is detected by the controller as it scans the sensor.The microcontroller now displays stop symbol on the led display to signal braking. So this system can be mounted on backside of a 2 wheeler or a 4 wheeler for automatic turning as well as braking indicator that will be visible even in daylight.</p>

With the advent digital electronics, this task can be automated by this project that has been specially designed for this scenario. It can be used in School for ringing class timeout bells as well as in factories and industries for various purposes.

                                    <p className="pb-5">A Bell can be connected at the output side of the project board. This bell will be rung by the system on a periodic basis to signify to the persons around it to start a task or about timeout of a task. This feature is helpful for teachers in school to timely take classes. It can be useful in factories to start work, indicate breaks as well as closing of the factory. The design of the circuit makes this project possible to count periods of 45 minutes and a lunch break of 30 minutes.

But every one desires different light intensity while reading, writing and need to adjust study lamps accordingly from time to time. Well here we come up with a very friendly and modern study lamp that operates as per the user without even touching it. The smart study lamp uses a STM32 based controller with integrated sensors to achieve this task.
                                    </p>

                                    <p className="pb-5">These added features are integrated to make the study lamp even more friendly and make night studying more comfortable. The system uses STM32 based controller with 2 Sensors, LED controller and LED panel to achieve this task. The system constantly monitors the sound sensor for a clap sound to start. If a sound is detected the sensor triggers a signal which is detected by the STM32 controller. On detection the controller turns on the lamp with default settings.</p>

                                    <p className="pb-5 ">The user may also turn off the system with another clap in same way. Once on the controller now monitors the gesture sensor for any movements. Any left right movements detected on the sensor are used by controller to switch between LED colors.</p>

                                    <p className="pb-5">Left/right side movement when detected by controller is programmed to toggle between bright white and warm white light color. In case a up and down gesture movement when detected by sensor triggers an intensity change. An upward swipe if detected leads to an increase in intensity while a downward swipe leads to lowering of intensity.</p>

Three layer architecture of the e-Learning platform is provided to facilitate the sharing, reusing learning objects and interoperability among various learning content efficiently. The middleware layer imports an indexing module and a metadata transformation module to complete metadata exchange among acknowledged e-Learning standards. Therefore, learners can make use of available learning objects without having to be affiliated with other LMS. The proposed e-Learning platform based on Cloud computing infrastructure would allow the independent LMS embedded in different e-Learning standards to share the learning objects. In short, you can say cloud computing will help huge amount of learning objects to be accessed reliably and flexibly over the Internet.

As a result of which many people prefer doing exercises or gym workouts at their home itself. However, a gym workout or exercise done without following the right procedure or positions and done without the proper guidance of a trainer can damage your muscles. Also, hiring a personal trainer may not fit everyone’s budget.

This application will guide the users on various body exercises with step-by-step positions with images. The users can keep a track of the data of day-to-day exercises. The Gym Buddy application contains a list of all exercises based on different types & categories (i.e., workout for Abs, Chest, Biceps, etc.).</p>

Each Workout or exercise is well explained in details along with 2 photos showing the start and end pose, so that user can check his posture like in the photo and can imitate it properly. User can enter weight or set based on current date and can add multiple entries for each date. All the exercise data has to be directly added in the code, there are no modules to manage them and backend used is SQLite.</p>
